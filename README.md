1.⁠ ⁠Title:Blockchain-based Certificate Verification System
2.⁠ ⁠Description:This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology to securely issue, store, and verify academic or professional certificates. By using a smart contract on a blockchain network, institutions can prevent certificate forgery and ensure authenticity. The system allows institutions to upload certificates, which are then permanently recorded on the blockchain, and provides a simple interface for employers or other institutions to verify credentials.
3.⁠ ⁠Vision of the project:To create a transparent, immutable, and universally accessible platform for certificate issuance and verification that eliminates fraud, builds trust, and streamlines credential validation processes across educational and professional sectors globally.
4.⁠ ⁠future Scope:Integration with government education boards and universities.

Expansion to include digital IDs, transcripts, and degrees.

Support for multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana).

Mobile application for real-time certificate verification.

AI-powered analytics for tracking verification trends and detecting fraud patterns.

APIs for integration with LMS (Learning Management Systems) and HR software.
5.⁠ ⁠Contract Details:0x1f87a6b87ae20063930dac253bf3e5ce90b2e1ac4da0c85f2d89d9637139cce5
