1. Title: 
**Blockchain-based Certificate Verification System**

---

2. Description:
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology to securely issue, store, and verify academic or professional certificates. By using a smart contract on a blockchain network, institutions can prevent certificate forgery and ensure authenticity. The system allows institutions to upload certificates, which are then permanently recorded on the blockchain, and provides a simple interface for employers or other institutions to verify credentials.

3. Vision of the Project:  
To create a transparent, immutable, and universally accessible platform for certificate issuance and verification that eliminates fraud, builds trust, and streamlines credential validation processes across educational and professional sectors globally.

---

4. Future Scope:
- Integration with government education boards and universities.
- Expansion to include digital IDs, transcripts, and degrees.
- Support for multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana).
- Mobile application for real-time certificate verification.
- AI-powered analytics for tracking verification trends and detecting fraud patterns.
- APIs for integration with LMS (Learning Management Systems) and HR software.
